In order to create the executable, run make.

This program requires a configurable *.txt file in the following format:
numbers_per_thread = number
thread_num = number

Due to time limitations, the parsing is done in the 42 style, which is the method I am most familiar with.

I havenâ€™t had time to provide a tester.
